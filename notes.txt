sql construction conventions
1. first view should simply set fields and table / schema
2. all files should be DDL (should create permanent database objects, not just execute queries)
3. all files should contain a single ddl operation


questions
- need to create a destination schema for views created.
  - should be separate schema for each source system or all together in a single schema?
- how should unit / integration / regression testing work? the last two, especially, are a huge deal.
- what's the best way to execute a bunch of sql statements in a row even with the sql source being in independent files?
- how do these get documented in an SEO-friendly way? coming across one of these in github will scare off most medium-technical biz users...
